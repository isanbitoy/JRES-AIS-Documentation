The current student profiling system store records in the guidance office. The
problem with this way of storing data is that it can take effort and time on
finding a specific student file/information when it is needed. The reason why there must
be a new structured student profiling system in the organizaton.

Grades are submited very late because most teachers fail to submit student grades on time. The teachers encounter some problems or difficulty in computing the grades of the students. Marking grades in a every student report card would take time and a tedious work for teachers. The said reasons are telling that this is one of the hardest problem that the organization have encountered.
